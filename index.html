  <h1>Meta Interview Prep ‚Äì James Westover</h1>

  <h2>üëã Quick Introduction</h2>
  <p>I'm James Westover, a systems architect and Python expert with 15+ years of experience spanning backend systems, data pipelines, geospatial infrastructure, and autonomous vehicle platforms. I‚Äôve led major platform efforts at Uber, Postmates, HERE, and now serve as CTO at a consulting firm. I'm especially interested in impactful backend systems that bridge physical data and cloud infrastructure.</p>

     <strong>T:</strong> Build and scale ingestion infrastructure, ensuring GDPR compliance.<br>
     <strong>A:</strong> Led cross-org teams, built ingestion via Cassandra/Kafka, deployed multipath-aware correction (ShadowMaps).<br>
     <strong>R:</strong> 80% ‚Üí 97% success rate, enabled RideCheck, saved $30M+ in fraud.</p>

  <h2>üöÄ Project 2: Python Platform at Uber</h2>
  <p><strong>S:</strong> Uber had widespread technical debt with legacy Python 2 services.<br>
     <strong>T:</strong> Drive company-wide Python 2‚Üí3 migration.<br>
     <strong>A:</strong> Built dependency graph, targeted 90%+ of services, mentored teams.<br>
     <strong>R:</strong> Full migration completed pre-EOL, improved developer velocity and stability.</p>

  <h2>üìà Project 3: NJ Transit Vision POC (Neher)</h2>
  <p><strong>S:</strong> NJ Transit sought a real-time behavioral monitoring system.<br>
     <strong>T:</strong> Architect POC system with AWS + client dashboard.<br>
     <strong>A:</strong> Built ECS-based pipeline with Rekognition + SageMaker, mobile viewer, led delivery.<br>
     <strong>R:</strong> Delivered demo in under 6 weeks, opened new partnership opportunity.</p>

  <h2>üõ† Optional Project: HERE FleetVision + Map Pipelines</h2>
  <p>Real-time ingest and analytics platform for autonomous fleet data (Kafka, Storm, Elasticsearch). Led dev for orchestration system (‚ÄúWeatherman‚Äù), sensor fusion, and embedded integrations with partners (Intel, Nvidia, Mercedes).</p>

  <h2>üí¨ Sample STAR Interview Questions & Answers</h2>

  <h3>1. Tell me about a time you leveraged cross-functional partnerships to solve a business challenge.</h3>
  <p><strong>Uber Location Platform:</strong> Coordinated across legal, privacy, and infra teams to build GDPR-compliant location pipelines. Balanced performance needs with privacy constraints. Resulted in successful global launch and key features like RideCheck.</p>

  <h3>2. Tell me about a time when your team had a conflict or disagreement with another team.</h3>
  <p><strong>Uber Navigation:</strong> Disagreement with ML team on off-route heuristics. Built Python simulator to test competing approaches, leading to consensus around revised parameters. Simulation capacity scaled 20x during this project.</p>

  <h3>3. Walk me through a project that required collaboration across functions.</h3>
  <p><strong>Postmates Integration:</strong> Managed customer identity compliance flows during Uber acquisition. Worked with infra, legal, and ops. Ensured continuity and compliance in Go-based services and legacy systems.</p>

  <h2>‚ùì Questions to Ask Interviewer</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>How are scope and impact defined for L7 IC roles at Meta?</li>
    <li>What‚Äôs the engineering culture around experimentation vs. platform stability?</li>
    <li>How are initiatives aligned across orgs (infra, product, AI, etc.)?</li>
    <li>How are technical leaders involved in hiring and mentoring?</li>
    <li>What do you personally enjoy most about working at Meta?</li>
  </ul>

</p>

  <h2>üß± Additional Projects & Contributions</h2>

  <h3>Uber Navigation Engine Enhancements</h3>
  <p><strong>S:</strong> Urban off-route detection lagged behind expectations.<br>
     <strong>T:</strong> Improve responsiveness in dense cities.<br>
     <strong>A:</strong> Introduced cross-street heuristics and route object enhancements, boosting detection speed.<br>
     <strong>R:</strong> Reduced off-route detection time from minutes to seconds, improved rider and driver UX in metro regions.</p>

  <h3>Postmates Python 3 Migration</h3>
  <p><strong>S:</strong> Legacy Python 2 monorepo impacted security and CI/CD.<br>
     <strong>T:</strong> Lead migration to Python 3.<br>
     <strong>A:</strong> Orchestrated K8s test parallelism, reduced CI from 50 to 15 mins.<br>
     <strong>R:</strong> Enabled safe modernization of codebase, improved build throughput and release confidence.</p>

  <h3>HERE FleetVision 2</h3>
  <p><strong>S:</strong> Need for real-time fleet monitoring and debugging for autonomous programs.<br>
     <strong>T:</strong> Build an integrated driver/engineer-facing stack.<br>
     <strong>A:</strong> Delivered Tornado + React app with real-time GPS/camera/IMU data, OTA pipeline, CI/CD automation.<br>
     <strong>R:</strong> Enabled day-to-day fleet ops and downstream QA initiatives.</p>

  <h2>üìö More Sample STAR Prompts & Answer Concepts</h2>

  <h3>4. Describe a time when you made a technical decision that wasn‚Äôt initially popular.</h3>
  <p><strong>Uber Python Platform:</strong> Chose to fully deprecate legacy Tornado-based RPC (TChannel) despite resistance. Provided wrapper APIs and support docs to minimize disruption. Eventually gained adoption across most teams.</p>

  <h3>5. How do you handle conflicting priorities from multiple stakeholders?</h3>
  <p><strong>HERE Capture Stack:</strong> Managed embedded and cloud priorities with Intel and Audi. Established lightweight OKRs per track, delegated decision-making to embedded team leads, aligned priorities via biweekly syncs.</p>

  <h3>6. Tell me about a time you had to learn something quickly to make progress.</h3>
  <p><strong>Postmates Observability:</strong> Needed to debug unfamiliar Go-based identity system and implement tracing via OpenTelemetry. Self-guided through docs and instrumentation, then coordinated with ops to validate output.</p>

  <h3>7. A project where you failed or underdelivered ‚Äî what happened?</h3>
  <p><strong>Neher Transit Bid:</strong> Built POC dashboard but client awarded contract to competitor with more hardware integrations. Used feedback to strengthen future bids and focus scope on software readiness and deployment playbooks.</p>

  <h2>üìå Leadership & Philosophy</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Mentorship:</strong> Supported dozens of engineers through language migrations, platform upgrades, and architectural reviews.</li>
    <li><strong>Org Design:</strong> Built and scaled teams from scratch at HERE and Uber, organizing by functional domain (backend, embedded, infra).</li>
    <li><strong>Values:</strong> Pragmatic, low-ego, curious. Focused on unblocking teams, advocating for clarity, and mentoring with compassion.</li>
    <li><strong>Learning:</strong> Passionate about Python, automation, and mapping. Regularly prototype with FastAPI, Streamlit, and emerging ML ops tools.</li>
